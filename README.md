# SurSkel-A-Generative-Model-for-Human-Skeleton-X-ray-Images-Prediction

This project is related to the paper "SurSkel-A-Generative-Model-for-Human-Skeleton-X-ray-Images-Prediction". In our work, we did different experiments, here we just list the SurSkel mdoel we designed and related training pipeline. As for the augmentated method including unconditional image generation and diffusion-based image super-resolution process, we recommend you to utilize the open python package MONAI and the work "ResShift".

We also provided two synthetic human x-ray image dataset, because our research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource, we submitted the data to the company and they will release the data after the company's review is completed.
